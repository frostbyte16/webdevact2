      <h4>Kätzlein Cocktail</h4>
      <p>Despite being a bartender at Cat's Tail, she actually despises alcohol and wants nothing more than to ruin Mondstadt's wine industry—a feat easier said than done when her patrons absolutely love her drinks. She is the daughter of Draff, a hunter in Springvale.</p>

      <h3>Chongyun</h3>
      <h4>Frozen Ardor</h4>
      <p>An exorcist from Liyue, Chongyun was born with excessive yang (positive) energy, which has proven to be both a help and a hindrance. It makes him a very effective exorcist, but it also means he has never seen a spirit for himself — they flee before he can even lay eyes on them. It has also made him particularly susceptible to any kind of heat or strong emotion, which leads to some rather... unexpected results.</p>
